<h1 align="center">🤖 - Free OpenAI Operator alternative - 👥</h1>

Open CUA Kit (Computer Use Agent), or Open-CUAK (pronounced "quack" 🦆🗣️), is THE platform for teaching, hiring and managing automation agents at scale — starting with browsers.

### 🎯 Why Open-CUAK?

In the real world, for real businesses, working with real people, reliability is everything.
When automation becomes reliable, it becomes scalable.
And when it becomes scalable, it becomes profitable.

That’s why Open-CUAK is designed to run and manage **thousands of** automation agents, ensuring each one is **reliable**.

This project is still in its very early days, but our team is working very hard to make it a reality, soon.
This is just the beginning of a new era in work, a new way to a world of **abundant productivity**.

And when productivity becomes truly abundant, we want to make sure it is **equally distributed**.

That's why we are making it open-sourced, today.

## Quick Start

### 👉 Start Local Production Build

0. (optional) Make sure you have [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) for package management

   > works on Mac and Linux. For Windows, use WSL2 for now.

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

   # (optional) on Linux, if `brew` command is not available in terminal, use this to register `brew`
   test -d ~/.linuxbrew && eval "$(~/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   test -d /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew && eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   echo "eval \"\$($(brew --prefix)/bin/brew shellenv)\"" >> ~/.bashrc

   # (optional) verify the successful installation of `brew`
   brew doctor
   ```

1. Install Open-CUAK package

   ```bash
   brew install Aident-AI/homebrew-tap/open-cuak

   # or use this to update to the latest version
   brew update && brew upgrade Aident-AI/homebrew-tap/open-cuak
   ```

2. Start Open-CUAK services

   > downloading images can take a while (Sorry! We will optimize this soon.)

   ```
   open-cuak start
   ```

3. Ta-da! It is now ready locally at [http://localhost:11970](http://localhost:11970).

## Demos

1. ### Agent Demo #1: Canva Use Agent

   An automation agent uses Canva to create a poster for President's Day. When it encounters issues, such as whether to use Pro templates (require a Canva paid plan), it proactively asks the user for additional instructions.

2. ### Agent Demo #2: Expedia Flight Search

   An agent uses built-in remote-browser running locally to search for flight tickets on Expedia.

3. ### Feature Demo: Account Management

   Account Management lets agents use your account and tools on your behalf.
